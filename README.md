# ChatBot Personal Doctor LLMs

## Description

Welcome to the AI Doctor Chatbot project, where we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a virtual healthcare assistant. This project aims to enhance user understanding of medical terminology and provide accurate health-related information.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Gymnasium:** Simulation environment for training the agent.
- **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework used to implement and train the DQN model.
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN):** Reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks for decision-making.

## Objective

- **Understanding LLMs: We'll begin by exploring the fundamental components of Large Language Models, including their architecture, parameters, and the mechanics behind text generation.**
- **Historical Context: Discover the pioneers of LLM technology and their contributions to the field.**
- **Technical Insights: Delve into the inner workings of LLMs, focusing on parameters and the context window that enables effective communication.**
- **Fine-Tuning Process: Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, specifically Llama 2 by Meta, using Hugging Face's tools to adapt it for our medical-themed conversations.**
- **Building the Chatbot: Finally, we'll integrate all these concepts to develop an AI Doctor Chatbot capable of answering medical queries, providing guidance, and assisting users with reliable health information.**
