# CNN model Pacman game

## Description

In this project, I developed an advanced AI model based on Deep Convolutional Q-Learning to train an agent capable of playing Pac-Man. The model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a fully connected neural network to process the visual inputs of the game. By combining CNN for image recognition and Deep Q-Learning for decision-making, the AI agent is able to "see" the game screen and take actions based on the rewards from the environment, learning optimal strategies over time.

The goal of this project was to implement a model that learns to master Pac-Man autonomously, improving performance by playing numerous rounds and learning from experience.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Gymnasium:** Simulation environment for training the agent.
- **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework used to implement and train the DQN model.
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN):** Reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks for decision-making.
